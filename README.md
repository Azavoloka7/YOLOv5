# YOLOv5 Object Detection for Image & Video  Processing

This project demonstrates how to perform object detection on videos using YOLOv5 model.

## Description

This script loads a pre-trained YOLOv5 model and applies it to a video file. It detects objects in each frame of the video, draws bounding boxes around them, and saves the annotated video.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- torch >= 1.7.0
- numpy >= 1.18.5
- opencv-python >= 4.2.0

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
